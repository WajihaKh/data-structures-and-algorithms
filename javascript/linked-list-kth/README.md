# Code Challenge 7

**Appraoch & Efficiency**:
I used a two-pointer approach, with a fast pointer moving k steps ahead of a slow pointer. This allows us to find the kth node from the end in a single pass through the list. The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

**Solution**:
To run the code and see examples of it in action, first, copy the provided Node and LinkedList classes into separate files. Then, create a test file and copy the provided test cases into it. Afterward, run the test file using a testing framework such as Jest. This will execute the test cases and display the results, showcasing how the findKthFromEnd method works in the LinkedList class.
