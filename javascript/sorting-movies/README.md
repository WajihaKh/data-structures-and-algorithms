# Sorting Movies in JavaScript

In software development, sorting data is a common task. Sorting movies by various criteria, such as year or title, is a scenario often encountered in applications dealing with movie databases or listings. In this article, we'll explore how to sort movies in JavaScript using two different criteria: by year and by title while ignoring leading articles.

## Introduction to the Code

The provided code offers two functions, `sortByYear` and `sortByTitle`, which sort an array of movie objects based on the year and title, respectively. Let's delve into each function to understand its purpose and implementation.

### `stripLeadingArticles`

Before diving into sorting by title, the code includes a utility function `stripLeadingArticles`. This function removes leading articles like "A", "An", or "The" from a movie title. This step ensures that titles are sorted alphabetically without considering these articles. Regular expressions are used to accomplish this task.

### `sortByYear`

The `sortByYear` function sorts the array of movie objects based on the year property in descending order. It utilizes the `sort` method, taking advantage of the numerical comparison between the `year` properties of movie objects.

### `sortByTitle`

The `sortByTitle` function sorts the array of movie objects alphabetically by title while ignoring leading articles. Similar to `sortByYear`, it also utilizes the `sort` method. However, before comparison, it applies the `stripLeadingArticles` function to both movie titles.

## Usage

To use these sorting functions in your JavaScript application, follow these steps:

1. Import the functions into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
const { sortByYear, sortByTitle } = require('./index.js');
