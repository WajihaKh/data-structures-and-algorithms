# Code Challenge 31

**Description**

I am  tasked with finding the first repeated word in a given string. This involves analyzing the input string and identifying the first word that occurs more than once.

**Approach and Efficiency**

Tokenization: Split the input string into words.
Finding the First Repeated Word: Iterate through the words, keeping track of seen words. Return the first repeated word encountered, if any.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
This approach efficiently tackles the problem by tokenizing the string and tracking seen
